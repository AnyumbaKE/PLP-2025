# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Assignment

## Objective
The purpose of this assignment is to:
- Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**.
- Perform basic descriptive statistics and groupings.
- Visualize the data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is **CRMreport.csv**, which contains customer subscription, billing, and package details.

### Columns
- **SUBS** â€“ Subscriber ID  
- **BILLCYCLE** â€“ Billing cycle  
- **INSTALLDATE** â€“ Date the service was installed  
- **NAME** â€“ Customer name  
- **FRANCHISE** â€“ Franchise or branch handling the customer  
- **CUSTOMER STATUS / status now** â€“ Current customer status  
- **NODE / M.NODE** â€“ Network node information  
- **Area** â€“ Customerâ€™s geographic area  
- **PKG** â€“ Package subscribed to  
- **SEG** â€“ Segment classification  
- **TEAM** â€“ Sales or support team  
- **PAS** â€“ (Field in dataset, can be used if relevant)  
- **DAYS** â€“ Number of subscription days  
- **BAND** â€“ Bandwidth plan or capacity

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Load & Explore Dataset
- Imported CSV into Pandas DataFrame.
- Displayed first rows with `.head()`.
- Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates.
- Cleaned column names for consistency.

### Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics using `.describe()`.
- Grouped data (e.g., average **DAYS per package**).
- Observed trends across packages and franchises.

### Task 3: Visualizations
1. **Line Chart** â€“ Installations over time  
2. **Bar Chart** â€“ Average `DAYS` per package  
3. **Histogram** â€“ Distribution of `DAYS`  
4. **Scatter Plot** â€“ Relationship between `DAYS` and `BAND`  

All charts were customized with titles, labels, and saved to the `outputs/` folder.

---

## Findings / Observations
- Customer subscription days vary significantly across different packages.  
- Some packages show longer retention, suggesting stronger customer loyalty.  
- Installation counts over time highlight possible growth or seasonal dips.  
- The scatter plot of `DAYS` vs `BAND` indicates potential clusters (heavy users vs casual users).
